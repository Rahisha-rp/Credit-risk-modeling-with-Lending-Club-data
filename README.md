# Credit Risk Modeling with Lending Club Data

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict loan defaults using the Lending Club dataset.  
It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, handling class imbalance, and model training with Logistic Regression and XGBoost.

## Features
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and one-hot encoding
- Handling class imbalance with SMOTE
- Model training & evaluation (Logistic Regression and XGBoost)
- Model interpretation via feature importance

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Lending Club dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club)
- File used: `accepted_2007_to_2018Q4.csv.gz`
